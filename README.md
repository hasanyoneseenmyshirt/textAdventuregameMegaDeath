# textAdventuregameMegaDeath
It a text adveture game filled with danger in every corner.

I am learning how to code in python so i made a text adventure game based on the one in "Learn Python The Hard Way."
This uses classes and dictionaties and all the wonderful OOP topics I still dont understand.

Add to it whatever you want and lets make the most morbid text adventure game possible(or close to it).
